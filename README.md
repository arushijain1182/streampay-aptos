# StreamPay ‚Äì Subscription Micropayments

## Project Description

StreamPay is a decentralized subscription payment system built on the Aptos blockchain that enables seamless micropayments for recurring services. The smart contract facilitates automated monthly subscription payments between service providers and subscribers, eliminating the need for traditional payment processors and reducing transaction fees.

The system allows content creators, SaaS providers, and service businesses to set up subscription-based revenue models with transparent, blockchain-verified payment processing. Subscribers can easily manage their recurring payments through a single smart contract interface.
